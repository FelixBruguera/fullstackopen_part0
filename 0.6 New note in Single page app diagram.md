Exercise: Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note using the single-page version of the app.


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram;
    participant Browser;
    participant Server;
    Browser->>Server:POST "https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa", Request Payload: {"content": text, "date": timestamp};
    Note left of Browser: In the SPA version of the exampleapp, the form submission is handled <br> in the Javascript file, preventing the default form submission from the browser <br> and therefore avoiding to reload the page after submission. To update the content <br> without making a request to the server, the new notes are stored in an array <br> and rendered every time the form is submitted.;
    Server-->>Browser: 201 Created, {"message":"note created"};
